                <h2>School Groups</h2>
                <p>Teaching in schools is another of Louise's harping activities, for group sizes up to 15 children. With a fleet of fifteen cardboard harps she can provide all the materials needed for a very different musical experience. Louise also teaches general musicianship and singing to whole classes.</p>
