Harp Resources
=========

One of the best things about harp courses is sharing music and resources.  To try and help in between courses we have created this page to share some of the places we know about.  If you have any ideas you would like to share then please let us know.  We've also included a [what we are doing](#usdoing) section which we will update regularly- if you want to join in then tell us what you are doing <info@northernharps.co.uk>.

We've broken the page up into the following sections:

* [Harpists](#harpists)
* [Places to buy harp stuff](#buy)
* [Other sources](#other)
* [What we are doing](#usdoing)
