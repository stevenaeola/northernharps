Lunch Time

For lunch we will be providing soup, salad and bread which people can eat in
the hall. If the weather is fine we can sit around on the village
green and there are plenty of walks you might like to try. On the
booking form there is space for you to tell us about any special
dietary requirements you may have.

Later in the Day
----------------

After teaching finishes in the afternoon on you've
got a few hours to relax before the evening's entertainment
starts. We'll be providing nibbles at the evening events but you may
wish to grab something more substantial.

The Cross Keys pub in Esh village offers good pub food and is a short
walk from the venue. Slightly further along the hill top (twenty minutes walk) is the New
Board Inn, with spectacular views and good food. Alternatively Durham
has a wide variety of restaurants, and there are take-aways and
restaurants nearer to the venue. We are more than happy to offer
suggestions and advice before the course or at the time.
