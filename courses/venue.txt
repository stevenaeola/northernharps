The course will be held at [Brancepeth Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brancepeth_Castle), Brancepeth village, about five
miles south-west of Durham city, north-east England. The original building dates back to Norman times, with the current building largely a renovation from the 1820s, and Grade I listed. It is a dramatic and beautiful setting for our harp course, and offers us plenty of space and atmosphere. There is some accommodation in the castle itself and camping is also available in the grounds, with access to shower facilities etc inside the castle.

Directions
----------

The post code of the castle is DH7 8DF.

If you are travelling north on A1M the simplest directions are to  leave the motorway at Junction 61. Follow the A177 to Durham and through Durham towards Crook on the A690. The A690 passes through Brancepeth, where you turn left at the crossraods towards the castle. There is plenty of parking just outside the castle courtyard. If you are travelling from the north take Junction 62 on the A1 and follow the A690 all the way to Brancepeth. If you have a satnav then plug in the postcode and follow the back roads!
