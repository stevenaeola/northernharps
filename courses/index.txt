            <p class="lead" markdown='1'>Northern Harps are running a four day clarsach course at Brancepth Castle, Durham, led by Wendy Stewart with Louise Bradley on the 7th-10th August 2017 (Monday to Thursday). This is the tenth year we have run this course, and the fourth year that we have had the course at [Brancepeth Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brancepeth_Castle).</p>

Wendy is a performer, teacher and writer of some of the best harp music in Scotland today.  She performs and teaches the clarsach internationally, as well as recording and publishing her compositions.  More details about Wendy can be found at [her website](http://www.wendystewart.co.uk).

The course will take place at [Brancepeth Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brancepeth_Castle) in the beautiful village of Brancepeth (where else?) only 5 miles from the historic city of Durham. 

The course will cost &pound;220, which will include four days of teaching, lunches and refreshments.

We will also be running social events, so please bring family, friends and other instruments.
