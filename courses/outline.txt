Course Outline
==============

Music will be taught by ear, with notation provided at the end of
the course for those who would like it. 

There will be a maximum group size of 15 and there will be breakout
groups with additional support from assistant tutors if needed. Note
that you need to have some familiarity with playing the harp: this is
not a course for absolute beginners. You also need to be over 16 to
attend the course.

We will provide hot and cold drinks, cakes and biscuits for the
teaching breaks plus lunches. We are __not__ providing evening meals
but there are plenty of options nearby and we are happy to advise you
on this.
