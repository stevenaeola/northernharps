Parts of the ceremony
===========

Whether you are looking for something special to complete the magic of your ceremony or you want to treat your guests afterwards the harp adds a touch of class to any occasion. 

* During the Ceremony - Louise will play for up to 30 minutes beforehand (depending on the venue), play your special choice of music while you process up the aisle, entertain your guests while you sign the register, and play as you and your guests leave the ceremony room or church. * Drinks reception - she will play for the entirety of the drinks reception and can move if, for example, the sun starts to shine and all your guests move outside. * Wedding breakfast - She will move into the dining room in time for your guests to be shown to their tables, play right through the meal and leave just before the speeches start. (unless you start with the speeches, in which case until the meal is finished)


Prices
------
Unlike many performers Louise’s prices are quoted for the section of the wedding (or other occasion) rather than by the hour so if your meal is delayed for any reason she will continue to play until you are ready rather than leave in the middle or demand more money afterwards.

Her price system is quite simple. One section of the wedding is £260, two consecutive sections are £340 and all three sections are £420, the three sections being 

* During the Ceremony
* Drinks Reception
* Wedding Breakfast

The ceremony and the wedding breakfast combined is a little more due to the wait in between them at £350

All these prices include reasonable (approx. 1 hour) travel from Durham and between venues if necessary but could be affected by longer travel times so it is important to request a quote.
